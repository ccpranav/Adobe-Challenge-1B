# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Core Methodology (500 words)

Our solution for persona-driven document intelligence employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines structural document analysis with semantic understanding to extract and prioritize content based on user context.

### 1. Document Processing and Structure Extraction

We use PyMuPDF (fitz) as our primary PDF processing library due to its efficiency and ability to preserve document structure. For each PDF, we extract not just the raw text but also critical layout information including font sizes, positions, and formatting. This structural metadata allows us to identify section boundaries, hierarchies, and relationships between content blocks without relying on predefined templates.

The extraction process preserves the logical flow of information while discarding irrelevant elements like headers, footers, and decorative components that don't contribute to the semantic content.

### 2. Semantic Representation and Matching

At the core of our solution is a lightweight yet powerful sentence transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) that creates dense vector representations of text. This model was selected specifically to balance performance with the 1GB model size constraint while providing high-quality semantic embeddings.

We create embeddings for:
- The persona description (combining role, expertise, and focus areas)
- The job-to-be-done statement
- Each extracted document section and subsection

These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, allowing us to compute similarity scores that reflect how relevant each document section is to the user's specific context and needs.

### 3. Context-Aware Ranking Algorithm

Our ranking algorithm combines multiple signals to determine the importance of each section:

1. **Semantic Relevance**: Cosine similarity between section embeddings and the combined persona+job embedding
2. **Structural Importance**: Weighting based on section hierarchy and position in the document
3. **Content Density**: Analysis of information richness within each section

This multi-factor approach ensures that we prioritize content that is not only topically relevant but also substantive and appropriately positioned within the document's knowledge structure.

### 4. Subsection Analysis and Extraction

For the highest-ranked sections, we perform a deeper analysis to identify key subsections. We segment the content into coherent blocks and evaluate each independently against the user context. This granular approach allows us to extract precisely the most relevant information snippets rather than entire sections that may contain mixed-relevance content.

### 5. Performance Optimization

To meet the 60-second processing constraint, we implement several optimization strategies:

- Multi-threaded document processing to parallelize work across CPU cores
- Efficient text chunking to avoid redundant processing
- Caching of intermediate results to prevent duplicate computations
- Early filtering of obviously irrelevant sections to reduce the embedding workload

These optimizations allow us to process 3-5 documents comfortably within the time constraint while maintaining high-quality analysis.

### 6. Output Generation

The final step transforms our analysis into the required JSON structure, including metadata, ranked sections, and subsection analysis. We ensure that all output conforms to the specified schema while providing rich, actionable information that directly addresses the user's job-to-be-done.

By combining structural document understanding with semantic analysis and context-aware ranking, our solution delivers highly relevant content extraction that adapts to diverse personas and tasks across any document domain.
